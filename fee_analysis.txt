FEE IMPACT ANALYSIS & PLATFORM COMPARISON
======================================================================

[CURRENT STATUS - NEW MODEL SESSION]
  Starting Balance:  $10,000.00
  Current Balance:   $9998.12
  Total P&L:         $-1.88
  Realized (Fees):   $-0.73
  Unrealized (Move): $-1.14

[FEE BREAKDOWN]
  Fees Paid:         $0.73
  % of Total Loss:   39.0%
  Price Movement:    $-1.14
  % of Total Loss:   61.0%

[MODEL PERFORMANCE]
  Avg Predicted Edge: 6.52 bps
  Signals > 8bps:     9/20 (45%)

======================================================================
PLATFORM COMPARISON
======================================================================

[CURRENT: HYPERLIQUID]
  Taker Fee:         5 bps (0.05%)
  Maker Fee:         0.2 bps (0.002%)
  Slippage:          ~1 bps
  Total Cost (Taker): 6 bps per side = 12 bps round-trip
  Total Cost (Maker): 1.2 bps per side = 2.4 bps round-trip

[ALTERNATIVE: LIGHTER (ZERO FEES)]
  Taker Fee:         0 bps
  Maker Fee:         0 bps
  Slippage:          ~1-2 bps (potentially higher, less liquidity)
  Total Cost:        1-2 bps round-trip

======================================================================
IMPACT ANALYSIS
======================================================================

[CURRENT SETUP (Hyperliquid Taker)]
  Required Edge:     8.0 bps
  Model Avg Edge:    6.52 bps
  Gap:               -1.48 bps
  Profitable?        NO (Close!)

[WITH ZERO FEES (Lighter)]
  Required Edge:     2.0 bps
  Model Avg Edge:    6.52 bps
  Gap:               4.52 bps
  Profitable?        YES (by 4.52 bps)

[ESTIMATED IMPROVEMENT]
  Fee Savings:       ~10 bps per round-trip
  Current Loss:      $1.88
  Without Fees:      ~$1.14 (just price movement)
  Potential Gain:    $0.73 saved on fees

======================================================================
CONSEQUENCES OF SWITCHING
======================================================================

[PROS]
  + Zero trading fees = immediate 10 bps advantage
  + Lower hurdle (2 bps vs 8 bps) = more trades
  + Current model (6.5 bps avg) becomes profitable
  + Estimated improvement: +$0.73 per trade cycle

[CONS]
  - Lower liquidity = potentially higher slippage
  - Less established platform = higher risk
  - May need API changes/testing
  - Unknown execution quality

[RISK ASSESSMENT]
  Risk Level:        MEDIUM
  Reasoning:         Model is borderline profitable on Hyperliquid
                     but would be clearly profitable on Lighter.
                     Switching makes mathematical sense IF liquidity
                     and execution quality are comparable.

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
======================================================================

[SWITCH TO LIGHTER - RECOMMENDED]
  Your model generates ~6.5 bps average edge.
  This is NOT enough on Hyperliquid (needs 8 bps)
  but WOULD BE profitable on Lighter (needs 2 bps).

  Action Plan:
  1. Test Lighter API integration (paper trading)
  2. Verify execution quality and slippage
  3. If comparable, switch to Lighter
  4. Expected result: Turn -$1.88 loss into small profit
